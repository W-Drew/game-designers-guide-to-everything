# Boundary pushers:

## Valheim:
Most games' base building has specific snap points that a limited set of building pieces (floor, wall, roof) are allowed to be placed in. This always limited what players could build. Valheim pushed these boundaries by decomposing the building pieces further and allowing them to be placed anywhere so long as they are supported by other pieces. The new pieces available such as pillars and half/quarter pieces are still limited and not a significantly larger burden for the content pipeline, but allowed players to get significantly more creative in building railings, supports (both functional and decorative), window/door trim, etc.

## Enshrouded:
Enshrouded takes the classic voxel building formula and adapts it into a form that fits most game art styles. Many games have blended voxel terrain into a more traditional art style, but Enshrouded is the first to apply that to buildings. Its buildings look like they were tailor made as a whole piece in a 3D modeling program and not out of voxels, and you could be forgiven if you thought it was set-piece based like Valheim as it provides prefabs that allow placing objects in a similar manner without having to place architecture voxel by voxel, but it's possible to drill down into per-voxel edits which allow for extremely creative builds.
